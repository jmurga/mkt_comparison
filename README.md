# The Imputed McDonald and Kreitman test (impMKT):
straightforward correction that significantly increases the evidence of positive selection of gene-by-gene MKT analyses

Here, we perform a comparison of five different MKT  methods: (i) the standard (original) MKT (sMKT, McDonald and Kreitman  1991); (ii) the Fay, Wickoff and Wu correction (FWWMKT, Fay 2001); (iii) a new imputation method based on FWWMKT (imputedMKT); (iii) the Extended MKT (eMKT, Mackay et al. 2012); and (iv) the asymptotic MKT (aMKT, Messer  and Petrov 2012) and (v) Grapes (Galtier 2016)

Both real and simulated population genomics data are used  to assess their performance for different evolutionary scenarios.  Genome-wide DNA variation data come from  Drosophila Genome Nexus and the 1000GP. Simulated data was generated with the SLiM 3  evolutionary framework (Haller â€Ž2019). We test several conditions  including gene-to-gene vs gene pooling analysis on the power and bias of selection estimates of the  different MKT methods.
